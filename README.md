# Jethro Pastoral Ministry Manager

Jethro Pastoral Ministry Manager is a web-based tool which helps churches keep track of people, families, groups, attendance, pastoral tasks, church services, rosters and documents.  Jethro doesn't force you to work in a particular way but gives you flexible, lightweight tools to support your own style of ministry.  

The Jethro software is free and open source (GPL) and runs on a standard [LAMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) web server.  Jethro's real advantages come to the fore when it's running on a proper web server, but it can also be run on a single PC using [XAMPP](XAMPP).

Jethro PMM is the software that powers online services such as [Easy Jethro](http://easyjethro.com.au) who also offer a [demo system](http://easyjethro.com.au/demo/).

# Data Model
The following is a high-level overview of the objects in Jethro and how they relate.
* A **person** has a name and various other properties.
* Every person belongs to exactly one **family**.  A family is a collection of persons who live at the same address and are in some way related.
* Every person belongs to exactly one **congregation** - the main grouping within a church.  (One exception to this is persons with status 'contact', who can be congregation-less).
* A person can belong to various **groups** which can represent many things such as bible studies, volunteers for some role, people who are undergoing a welcoming process, people who have completed some particular training course, etc etc.
* A person's **attendance** at their congregation or a certain group can be recorded week by week
* **Notes** can be added to persons or families.  These may simply record extra free-form information about the person, or may be assigned to a Jethro user for action (eg "call Mr Smith").
* A **report** can show persons who match certain rules regarding their personal details, group memberships etc etc.
* A **service** is when a congregation meets together on a certain date, and has various details such as the topic and what bible passages are to be used.
* A service's **run sheet** can contain several **service components** such as songs, prayers, etc, selected from the congregation's repertoire.
* A **roster role** is some role to be played in a service, eg reading the bible
* A **roster view** is a collection of roster roles which are viewed or edited together (eg all the roles for the evening service, or the 'preacher' roles for all services)
* A **roster assignment** is when a person is assigned to a certain roster role for a particular service.

# Naming

Jethro is designed to facilitate and encourage good team ministry, so its name comes from Exodus 18:13-23 where Moses is introduced by his father in law to the important skill of **delegation**.  His father in law was named Jethro.
