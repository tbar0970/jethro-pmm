How sweet the soundThat saved a wretch like me!I once was lost, but now am found;Was blind, but now I see.'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,And grace my fears relieved;How precious did that grace appearThe hour I first believed!Through many dangers, toils and snares,I have already come;'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,And grace will lead me home.The Lord has promised good to me,His Word my hope secures;He will my Shield and Portion be,As long as life endures.Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,And mortal life shall cease,I shall possess, within the veil,A life of joy and peace.The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,The sun forbear to shine;But God, who called me here below,Will be forever mine.When we've been there ten thousand years,Bright shining as the sun,We've no less days to sing God's praiseThan when we'd first begun."Crown him with many crowns,Diademata,3,,,full,23938,"Words by Matthew Bridges & Godfrey ThringMusic: ""Diademata"" by George Elvey 1868","Crown Him with many crowns,The Lamb upon His throne.Hark! How the heav'nly anthem drownsAll music but its own.Awake, my soul, and singOf Him who died for thee,And hail Him as thy matchless kingThrough all eternity.Crown Him the virgin's son,The God incarnate born,Whose arm those crimson trophies wonWhich now His brow adorn;Fruit of the mystic rose,As of that rose the stem;The root whence mercy ever flows,The Babe of Bethlehem.Crown Him the Son of God,Before the worlds began,And ye who tread where He hath trod,Crown Him the Son of Man;Who every grief hath knownThat wrings the human breast,And takes and bears them for His own,That all in Him may rest.Crown Him the Lord of life,Who triumphed o'er the grave,And rose victorious in the strifeFor those He came to save.His glories now we sing,Who died, and rose on high,Who died eternal life to bring,And lives that death may die.Crown Him the Lord of peace,Whose power a scepter swaysFrom pole to pole, that wars may cease,And all be prayer and praise.His reign shall know no end,And round His pierc?d feetFair flowers of paradise extendTheir fragrance ever sweet.Crown Him the Lord of love,Behold His hands and side,Those wounds, yet visible above,In beauty glorified.No angel in the skyCan fully bear that sight,But downward bends his burning eyeAt mysteries so bright.Crown Him the Lord of Heav'n,Ethroned in worlds above,Crown Him the king to whom is giv'nThe wondrous name of Love.Crown Him with many crowns,As thrones before Him fall;Crown Him, ye kings, with many crowns,For He is king of all.Crown Him the Lord of lords,Who over all doth reign,Who once on earth, the incarnate Word,For ransomed sinners slain,Now lives in realms of light,Were saints with angels singTheir songs before Him day and night,Their God, Redeemer, king.Crown Him the Lord of years,The potentate of time,Creator of the rolling spheres,Ineffably sublime.All hail, Redeemer, hail!For Thou has died for me;Thy praise and glory shall not failThroughout eternity."
